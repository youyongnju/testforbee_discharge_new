# Resource Blocks
Selects the number of allocated resource blocks. This parameter influences the
allowed modulation types.

Version
Some TDD RMCs defined by 3GPP have the same channel bandwidth, number of
RBs, modulation type and transport block size index. The parameter "Version" is introduced
to distinguish between these RMCs.
For the meaning of the version values, see chapter 2.2.12.3, "DL RMCs, Multiple TX
Antennas", on page 51.

RB Position/Start RB
The RBs can be allocated at the lower or upper end of the cell bandwidth. The resulting
number of the first allocated RB is displayed for information.
